## Statistical Risk Evaluation and Forecasting

This project aims to conduct a thorough risk analysis using statistical and financial metrics. 
The Jupyter Notebook (Risk_Analysis_Project.ipynb) explores key financial risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and other volatility measures. By employing statistical models like ARIMA, the project also forecasts future risk and volatility, providing insights into potential financial losses and helping decision-makers understand their exposure to risk.

## Key Features:

# Risk Metrics Calculation:

Value at Risk (VaR): Computes the maximum potential loss within a given confidence level (e.g., 95%, 99%) over a set time frame.
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR): Measures the expected loss beyond the VaR, offering a deeper insight into extreme risks (tail risk).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization of data trends using line plots, scatter plots, and other statistical representations to better understand underlying data patterns.
Statistical summaries such as mean, standard deviation, and distribution of returns.

## Time Series Forecasting:

ARIMA Model: Applied to forecast volatility and future risk, enabling predictions of potential financial risk based on historical data.
Comparison of actual vs. predicted results to assess the effectiveness of forecasting methods.

## Risk Visualization:

Graphs and plots displaying VaR, CVaR, and volatility over time, allowing for a visual understanding of risk exposure.
Comparison charts across different financial instruments or assets to understand relative risk.

## Optimization and Risk Management:

Techniques for mitigating risk by examining the trade-offs between returns and potential losses.
Use of visual analytics to present risk distribution and recommend strategies to reduce exposure.

## Visualizations and Insights:

## Risk Metrics Visualizations: 

The notebook produces visual representations of key risk metrics like VaR and CVaR, enabling clear communication of risk levels at various confidence intervals.
Volatility Forecasting: 

Time series forecasting techniques help in visualizing and predicting future financial volatility, which is crucial for risk management.
Summary Statistics: 

The notebook summarizes financial data through means, standard deviations, and other descriptive statistics that help in understanding the overall risk environment.

## Dependencies:

Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

statsmodels

scipy

## Conclusion:

By computing important risk measures including Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk, the risk analysis carried out for this project offers 
insightful information about possible financial losses (CVaR). Better risk management choices are made possible by the results, which show the maximum and 
expected losses at different confidence intervals. The ARIMA model, when used for time series forecasting, provides an outlook on future volatility. 
The visual aids improve comprehension of risk exposure in various contexts. All things considered, this approach provides consumers with the means to 
evaluate and successfully manage financial risks.
